# Printin

**Printin** is a simple web application built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** that allows users to upload documents for bulk printing. It's designed for users who need to print large quantities (e.g., 50–500+ copies) and provides a straightforward way to customize print options, checkout, and select between store pickup or delivery.

> **Note:** This is a test project and currently uses **Stripe's test mode** for payments. No real transactions are processed.
